Simple Door Opener
-------------------

This is the software and hardware needed to build an almost-open door.
The only exceptions are the keylock and the rfid readers, wich we're
not providing.
Any keylock working with a pulse of anything that your relay can move 
would work, anyway.
Also, for the RFID readers you'd need a HID RFID device, that is, a
rfid device that identifies itself as a HID and puts the key id on.

Some people would say that's dangerous, or insecure, but the reality
is that any rfid chip is dangerous, they're crackable in a few hours
so anyone can dupe it.

On the other hand, to duplicate de 0-sector of a rfid card, you need
special (and hard to get) cards, or a 300€ rfid card emulator.
A normal rfid reader writer for 40€ can break the security of anything
that is not using the 0-sector id for its auth.

Hardware
---------

You'll need:

- 2 * RFID readers able to work as HID devices
- 1 * Raspberry PI with raspian
- 1 * Electronic lock
- A relay board:
   - 5v relay
   - 1 Diode
   - 1 PNP Transistor
   - 1k resistor

Follow the schematics in hardware/ folder, but it's a satndard relay board.

Installation
-------------

First of all, note that the gpio library for python needs you to be able to
access to /dev/mem, wich means you'll need to execute it as root.
As this is not safe at all, I recommend adding a sudo exception to nopasswd
open_door and simpledod

Now, the software is divied in two parts:
- Web interface
    The main user management system
    It's designed to be able to open the door and register various events.
- Daemon
    The main daemon, listens to cards and opens the door if the card is allowed.

The web interface has a quite easy setup, just configure your apache to have
documentroot as /var/www/public, and set the UserManagement directory contents 
to /var/www

::

    apt-get install apache2 php5 php5-mysql # Use "root" as mysql password.
    cp -R UserManagement/* /var/www

Now, execute the confs/startup_site script, and it will be ready to go.

The startup daemon has a few more requisites, first of all, as said before,
configure your sudoers so everyone can open the door.
Now, add a user for the door opener (for example, dooropener)

::

    adduser dooropener


Now, put the confs/bashrc into ~/home/dooropener/.bashrc

::
    
    cp confs/bashrc ~/home/dooropener/.bashrc

And configure your inittab (dangerous, be careful!) to have tty1 autologin as dooropener user.

It should en something like this:

::

    1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty -a dooropener 38400 tty1

And you're ready to go!
Just remember to buy compatible cards!
